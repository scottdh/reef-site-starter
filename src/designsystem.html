        <h1>Ada Lovelace Biography</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          English mathematician Ada Lovelace, the daughter of poet Lord Byron,
          has been called "the first computer programmer" for writing an
          algorithm for a computing machine in the mid-1800s.
        </p>
        <h2>Who Was Ada Lovelace?</h2>
        <p>
          The daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of
          Lovelace — better known as "Ada Lovelace" — showed her gift for
          mathematics at an early age. She translated an article on an invention
          by Charles Babbage, and added her own comments. Because she introduced
          many computer concepts, Lovelace is considered the first computer
          programmer. She died on November 27, 1852.
        </p>
        <h2>Early years</h2>
        <p>
          Ada, born as Augusta Ada Byron on December 10, 1815, was the only
          legitimate child of the famous poet Lord George Gordon Byron. Lord
          Byron's marriage to Ada's mother, Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke Byron,
          was not a happy one. Lady Byron separated from her husband only weeks
          after their daughter was born. A few months later, Lord Byron left
          England, and Ada never saw her father again. He died in Greece when
          Ada was 8 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ada had an unusual upbringing for an aristocratic girl in the
          mid-1800s. At her mother's insistence, tutors taught her mathematics
          and science. Such challenging subjects were not standard fare for
          women at the time, but her mother believed that engaging in rigorous
          studies would prevent Ada from developing her father's moody and
          unpredictable temperament. Ada was also forced to lie still for
          extended periods of time because her mother believed it would help her
          develop self-control.
        </p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
          From early on, Ada showed a talent for numbers and language. She
          received instruction from William Frend, a social reformer; William
          King, the family's doctor; and Mary Somerville, a Scottish astronomer
          and mathematician. Somerville was one of the first women to be
          admitted into the Royal Astronomical Society.
